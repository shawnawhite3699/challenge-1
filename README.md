# challenge-1: Code refactor for Horiseon webpage

## Assigned tasks

Horiseon has an existing webpage with HTML, CSS, and associated images in place. The agency hired us and our tech lead provided specific criteria to refactor the existing code to improve accessibility by replacing non-semantic HTML with semantic HTML tags. By using semantic HTML, we also improve SEO so the page ranks higher in Google and other search engine results. 

We adhere to the Scout Rule, when working with others' code always leave it cleaner than you found it, so an additional task was consolidating CSS where possible. The end product now has more streamlined code while maintaining the original page functionality. 

A final task included testing functionality of all links on the page and fixing any broken links. The nav link for Search Engine Optimization was broken and is now functional.
